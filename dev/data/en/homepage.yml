  title : "Smart Wooden Lamps"
  content : "Almost always when we think of a lamp we think of
materials such as plastic, fabric and metal, which
are those that have been used traditionally. Natural
fibers and laminated wood allow for warm, woven
effects rich in texture but have limited shapes. It is
for this reason that luciole lamps seeks to rescue
the richness of colors and transparencies that wood
has, combining these qualities with the technology
that allows printing complex and improbable
shapes that generate new remote controlled lighting
effects to finally not only propose different shapes
but also new interactions with these 3d printed
wooden smart light objects."
